# Installation

Snaplet can either be self-hosted or accessed as a web app via our cloud service, Snaplet cloud. The choice is yours!

We recommend beginning with [Snaplet cloud](https://snaplet.dev). Sign up for free and start utilizing your data in mere minutes!

For those looking to delve deeper or self-host Snaplet, try our user-friendly `snaplet setup` CLI wizard!
