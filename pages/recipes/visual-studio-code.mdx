# Visual Studio Code

The [Snaplet VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=snaplet.snaplet-vscode) brings Snaplet's functionality into your editor, and is the fastest and easiest way to use Snaplet to get production-like data in your development environment.

The extension automatically restores your latest snapshot tagged `main` into a cloud preview database. By pointing your local database connection string to the Snaplet proxy, you will code against the production-like data captured in your snapshot and restored to this preview database.

Practically, what does this mean? No more changing environment variables or schema drift - you're always coding against data that's up to date against your latest snapshot. It's also is fully branchable: when you branch your code, Snaplet branches your database, keeping the two in sync.

Let's go ahead and get started on installing the extension.

<Steps>

### Installation

<Step image={{ src: "/recipes/vscode/vscode-01.webp", alt: "vscode-01"}}>
Install the Snaplet VS Code extension from the VS Code Marketplace listing
</Step>

### Link your Snaplet account

<Step image={{ src: "/recipes/vscode/vscode-02.webp", alt: "vscode-02"}}>
After installation, you'll find a Snaplet icon on the sidebar. Click the '**Connect to Snaplet**' button to open the Snaplet panel.
</Step>

### Pick the right project from inside Snaplet

<Step image={{ src: "/recipes/vscode/vscode-03.webp", alt: "vscode-03"}}>
Allow the Snaplet VS Code extension to open the URI when prompted.
</Step>

### Let the Snaplet extension read your project info

<Step image={{ src: "/recipes/vscode/vscode-04.webp", alt: "vscode-04"}}>
Allow VS Code to navigate to the Snaplet web app and then select the appropriate project you want to use in the VS Code extension, and click '**Connect**'. If prompted, allow [app.snaplet.dev](http://app.snaplet.dev) to open VS Code.
</Step>

### Verify the extension is linked to your account

<Step image={{ src: "/recipes/vscode/vscode-05.webp", alt: "vscode-05"}}>
Your Snaplet VS Code extension is now associated with your Snaplet account, and installed.
</Step>

### Switch your database connection string to the Snaplet proxy

<Step image={{ src: "/recipes/vscode/vscode-06.png", alt: "vscode-06"}}>
Change your local development database environment variable to point to: **`postgresql://snaplet@localhost:2345/snaplet`**.
</Step>

</Steps>

You're all done! Let's recap what we've done in this guide:

* You installed the Snaplet VS Code extension, and connected it to your active Snaplet project.
* You pointed your local development database environment variable to the Snaplet proxy in the extension.

You're now coding against the production-like data you captured originally as a snapshot. When you branch your code, Snaplet will also create a new database branch, keeping all your code and bug fixes isolated to a single database. You can also easily share this with colleagues - simply have them checkout the same branch, and they'll also have access to your data.
