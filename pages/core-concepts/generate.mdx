## The need for generated data

Generated data, or seed data, is a useful tool in software development, providing an initial set of data for your database.

Here's why it's beneficial:

- **Development:** Provides a consistent dataset for developers.
- **Testing:** Ensures predictability when verifying features.
- **Demonstration:** Showcases your software's abilities with example content.
- **Default Data:** Adds necessary built-ins, like country lists.
- **Onboarding:** Gives new users a filled-out starting point.
- **Performance:** Helps simulate heavy usage scenarios.
- **Guides:** Common reference in tutorials.

While generated data might be the unsung hero of early development, it can get a bit needy as software evolves. But don't sweat it! Our mission is to save you from the never-ending saga of maintaining those seed scripts. Who has time for that, right?

## Introducing the Snaplet Data Client

The key to effortless generated data is a tool that deeply understands your database's schema. By introspecting your database, we are able to create a fully-typed client dedicated to data generation.

Right now, the Snaplet Data Client is tied to our configuration file, but we intend to generate a standalone version that you will be able to use anywhere!

Let's see how it works.

## Generating data with `snaplet generate`

You can refer to the [Generate Quick Start Guide](/getting-started/quick-start/generate) to learn about the basics of the `snaplet generate` command.

### Connecting to existing data

Let's take a moment to understand what happened under the hood.

You used the **snaplet data client** to define a **plan**. We then executed this plan to generate **SQL statements**. Finally, we executed these SQL statements to **persist the data in your database**.

Internally, a plan persist the generated data in an in-memory object called a **store**. This is actually the store that is turned into SQL statements.

If we take our previous plan, its `store` would look like this:

```ts
const store = {
  User: [User, User, User, User],
  Post: [Post],
  Comment: [Comment, Comment, Comment],
}
```

This store is very useful when you want to `connect` your models together, reusing existing data instead of generating new one. Let's see how to do that.

#### Using `connect`

In addition to the `data` key, you can use the `connect` key to connect your models together.

<CH.Scrollycoding className="generate-tutorial-configuration-file">

Let's start from our previous plan.

```ts snaplet.config.ts
/// <reference path=".snaplet/snaplet.d.ts" />
import { defineConfig } from 'snaplet';
import { copycat } from '@snaplet/copycat';

export default defineConfig({
  generate: {
    plan({ snaplet }) {
      return snaplet.Post({
        data: {
          title: 'Hello World!',
          User: {
            data: {
              email: ({ seed }) =>
                copycat.email(seed, {
                  domain: 'acme.org'
                }),
            },
          },
          Comment: {
            count: 3,
          },
        },
      });
    },
  },
});
```

---

We specify that the author of each comment will be provided from an external source rather than being generated using the `connect` key.

```ts snaplet.config.ts
/// <reference path=".snaplet/snaplet.d.ts" />
import { defineConfig } from 'snaplet';
import { copycat } from '@snaplet/copycat';

export default defineConfig({
  generate: {
    plan({ snaplet }) {
      return snaplet.Post({
        data: {
          title: 'Hello World!',
          User: {
            data: {
              email: ({ seed }) =>
                copycat.email(seed, {
                  domain: 'acme.org'
                }),
            },
          },
          Comment: {
            count: 3,
            // focus(1:6)
            data: {
              User: {
                connect: () => {}
              }
            }
          },
        },
      });
    },
  },
});
```

---

We can use the injected `store` to provide the `User` model we want to connect to. In this case the only generated `User` in the plan will be the author of the post.

```ts snaplet.config.ts
/// <reference path=".snaplet/snaplet.d.ts" />
import { defineConfig } from 'snaplet';
import { copycat } from '@snaplet/copycat';

export default defineConfig({
  generate: {
    plan({ snaplet }) {
      return snaplet.Post({
        data: {
          title: 'Hello World!',
          User: {
            data: {
              email: ({ seed }) =>
                copycat.email(seed, {
                  domain: 'acme.org'
                }),
            },
          },
          Comment: {
            count: 3,
            data: {
              User: {
                connect: ({ store }) => {
                  // focus
                  return store.User[0];
                }
              }
            }
          },
        },
      });
    },
  },
});
```

</CH.Scrollycoding>

##### `graph`

If your plan is complex, it can be quite challenging to find the right model to connect to. That's why we also provide the `graph` variable to the `connect` function.

The `graph` contains all the data that was generated as part of the plan, arranged to follow the shape of your plan.

And here is how you can use it:

```ts snaplet.config.ts
/// <reference path=".snaplet/snaplet.d.ts" />
import { defineConfig } from 'snaplet';
import { copycat } from '@snaplet/copycat';

export default defineConfig({
  generate: {
    plan({ snaplet }) {
      return snaplet.Post({
        data: {
          title: 'Hello World!',
          User: {
            data: {
              email: ({ seed }) =>
                copycat.email(seed, {
                  domain: 'acme.org'
                }),
            },
          },
          Comment: {
            count: 3,
            data: {
              User: {
                // focus(1:4)
                // we alias the graph to posts to make it more readable
                connect: ({ graph: posts }) => {
                  return posts[0].User;
                }
              }
            }
          },
        },
      });
    },
  },
});
```

Here is what the `graph` looks like for this plan:

```ts
// as we started with snaplet.Post, the graph is an array of Post
const graph = [
  {
    User: User,
    Comment: [
      Comment,
      Comment,
      Comment
    ],
  },
];
```

##### `branch`

Now let's complexify our plan a bit:

- We want to generate 3 posts.
- The author of each post should also be the author of the post's comments.

It seems challenging to find the right User to connect to using `store` or `graph`. That's why we also provide the `branch` variable to the `connect` function.

The `branch` is a particular iteration of the `graph` that was generated. It matches the path to the `connect` function in which it is injected.

Let's take a look at the `branch` for our previous plan, adapted to our new requirements:

```ts snaplet.config.ts
/// <reference path=".snaplet/snaplet.d.ts" />
import { defineConfig } from 'snaplet';
import { copycat } from '@snaplet/copycat';

export default defineConfig({
  generate: {
    plan({ snaplet }) {
      return snaplet.Post({
        // focus
        count: 3,
        data: {
          title: 'Hello World!',
          User: {
            data: {
              email: ({ seed }) =>
                copycat.email(seed, {
                  domain: 'acme.org'
                }),
            },
          },
          Comment: {
            count: 3,
            data: {
              User: {
                // focus(1:4)
                // we alias the branch to post to make it more readable
                connect: ({ branch: post }) => {
                  return post.User;
                }
              }
            }
          },
        },
      });
    },
  },
});
```

Generating 3 posts will result in 3 branches, each containing a post, its author and its comments.

In our above example, the `connect` function will receive the branch corresponding to its iteration. So the first `connect` function will receive the first branch, the second `connect` function will receive the second branch, and so on.

Here is what the `branch` looks like for this particular `connect` function:

```ts
// as we started with snaplet.Post, the branch is a Post model
const branch = {
  User: User,
  Comment: Comment,
};
```

### Manipulating stores

We saw that a **plan** is persisting the generated data in a **store**, and the store will be turned into **SQL statements**.

Sometimes, it's easier to break down your plan into multiple plans, and then merge them together. That's why we provide the `pipe` and `merge` functions.

#### Using `pipe`

The `pipe` operator allows you to chain multiple plans together, injecting the `store` of the previous plan into the next plan.

```ts snaplet.config.ts
/// <reference path=".snaplet/snaplet.d.ts" />
import { defineConfig } from 'snaplet';
import { copycat } from '@snaplet/copycat';

export default defineConfig({
  generate: {
    plan({ snaplet, pipe }) {
      return pipe(
        snaplet.User({
          count: 3
        }),
        snaplet.Post({
          data: {
            User: {
              connect({ store }) {
                // this is the first User generated by the previous plan
                return store.User[0];
              }
            }
          }
        })
      );
    },
  },
});
```

##### `autoConnect`

We provide a special option that you can activate in the options of a plan, called `autoConnect`.

When `true`, the plan will automatically connect models relationships to fulfill to the store if possible. The corresponding model will be picked randomly (but deterministically, we're using `copycat.oneOf` method under the hood).

In the following example, the `Post` model will be connected to one of the 3 `User` in the store.

```ts snaplet.config.ts
/// <reference path=".snaplet/snaplet.d.ts" />
import { defineConfig } from 'snaplet';
import { copycat } from '@snaplet/copycat';

export default defineConfig({
  generate: {
    plan({ snaplet, pipe }) {
      return pipe(
        snaplet.User({
          count: 3
        }),
        // mark
        snaplet.Post({}, { autoConnect: true })
      );
    },
  },
});
```

#### Using `merge`

The `merge` operator allows you to merge multiple plans together, without injecting the `store` of the previous plan into the next plan. All stores stay independent and are merged together once all the plans are generated.

```ts snaplet.config.ts
/// <reference path=".snaplet/snaplet.d.ts" />
import { defineConfig } from 'snaplet';
import { copycat } from '@snaplet/copycat';

export default defineConfig({
  generate: {
    plan({ snaplet, merge }) {
      return merge(
        snaplet.User({
          count: 3
        }),
        snaplet.Post({}),
        snaplet.Comment({
          count: 2
        })
      );
    },
  },
});
```
