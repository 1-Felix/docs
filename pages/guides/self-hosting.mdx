## Bootstraping your configuration

In order to configure Snaplet, you need to generate a `snaplet.config.ts` file along with its types based on your database schema.

SNAPLET_SOURCE_DATABASE_URL=<postgres://your-prod-url> npx snaplet config generate --type typedefs --type transform
```

Once you're happy with your configuration, you can capture a snapshot of your production database.

```bash >_&nbsp;terminal
SNAPLET_SOURCE_DATABASE_URL=<postgres://your-prod-url> npx snaplet snapshot capture /tmp/my-snapshot
```

## Sharing snapshots via Snaplet Cloud

You can share your snapshots via Snaplet Cloud so all your teamates can use restore them.

```

You can restore a snapshot to a development database.

```bash >_&nbsp;terminal
SNAPLET_TARGET_DATABASE_URL=<postgres://your-development-url> npx snaplet snapshot restore /tmp/my-snapshot
