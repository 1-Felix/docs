# PostgreSQL

## Create a read-only role

Snaplet connects to your PostgreSQL database in order to create snapshots. We recommend that you give us read-only access to your database, and that you restrict connection to a specific set of IP addresses.

![Never cry over split milk!](/guides/postgresql/snappy-spilt-milk.svg)

Connect to your database and run the following SQL statements. These creates a `snaplet_readonly` user with the password `a very good password` and gives them the `snaplet_read_all_data` role.

PostgreSQL v14 includes a `pg_read_all_data` role. Run `SELECT version()` in PostgreSQL to determine your version.

<Callout type="warning">
Change the **username** and the **password**!
</Callout>

SELECT version();

-- We give the user BYPASSRLS privileges in order to introspect the db structure.

        EXECUTE format($$ ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES IN SCHEMA %I GRANT SELECT ON SEQUENCES TO snaplet_read_all_data $$, sch);
    END LOOP;
END;
$do$;
-- Create a "snaplet_readonly" user and associate the "snaplet_read_all_data" role.
-- We give the user BYPASSRLS privileges in order to introspect the db structure.
CREATE USER snaplet_readonly WITH PASSWORD 'a very good password' BYPASSRLS;
GRANT snaplet_read_all_data TO snaplet_readonly;
ALTER ROLE snaplet_readonly SET statement_timeout = 0;
```
</Tab>
</Tabs>

## Grant IP address access

Snaplet uses these IPs to connect to your database:

```bash
3.67.57.100
3.68.126.236
35.158.181.77
```

It's a good idea to restrict all traffic to PostgreSQL, and only grant access where it's absolutely required.

## Self-Signed Certificates

To make Snaplet work with servers using self-signed certificates. Please add `sslmode=require` to the database connection string:

```bash >_&nbsp;terminal
SNAPLET_DATABASE_URL='postgresql://<user>:<password>@<host>:<port>/<database>?sslmode=required&ssl=true&sslmode=require' snaplet snapshot restore
```

During the snapshot capture process, use `NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED=0`:

```bash >_&nbsp;terminal
NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED=0 SNAPLET_DATABASE_URL='postgresql://<user>:<password>@<host>:<port>/<database>?sslmode=required&ssl=true&sslmode=require' snaplet snapshot capture
```

## Connection strings

> Also known as Connection URLs

To connect to your database the CLI requires database credentials in the form of a connection string. A PostgreSQL connection url specifies the following parameters:

- username (the username used to connect to the database)
- password (the password used in the "user" parameter)
- hostname (the IP address or domain name of the machine where the server is running)
- port (port number on which the server is listening on)
- database (name of the database to connect to)

This connection string will also include a collection of parameter keywords (optional) that allow adjustments of various aspects of the url (e.g. SSL, timeouts, etc)

**Here's an example connection string:**

```bash
postgresql://username:password@hostname:5432/database_name
```

### Troubleshooting connection strings

When passing in a connection string to Snaplet, we will attempt to validate and encode the connection string, however you may still have problems with database names or passwords and special characters **`(%&/:=?@[])`**, in this case you may have to encode these characters manually.

> **Encoding manually:** you can manually encode individual segments of your connection url (password, database, etc.) using [encodeURIComponent](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/encodeURIComponent)

If you still have problems configuring your connection string, refer to this [short guide](https://www.prisma.io/dataguide/postgresql/short-guides/connection-uris) or reach out to us on [discord](https://app.snaplet.dev/chat) instead.
