# Connection Strings

In order to connect to your source database, Snaplet needs read-only database credentials in the form of a connection string, or connection URL. 

A PostgreSQL connection URL specifies the following parameters:

* **username** (the username used to connect to the database)
* **password** (the password used in the "user" parameter)
* **hostname** (the IP address or domain name of the machine where the server is running)
* **port** (port number on which the server is listening on)
* **database** (name of the database to connect to)

This connection string may also include a collection of optional parameter keywords that allow adjustments of various aspects of the URL (e.g. SSL, timeouts, etc).

Here's an example connection string:

```postgresql://username:password@hostname:5432/database_name```

### Troubleshooting
When passing in a connection string to Snaplet, we will attempt to validate and encode the connection string, however you may still have problems with database names or passwords with special characters (`%&/:=?@[]`), you may have to encode these characters manually.

Encoding manually: you can manually encode individual segments of your connection url (password, database, etc.) using [encodeURIComponent](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/encodeURIComponent)

If you have trouble configuring your connection string, you can to refer to this [Prisma guide](https://www.prisma.io/dataguide/postgresql/short-guides/connection-uris) or reach out to us on [Discord](https://app.snaplet.dev/chat) instead.
